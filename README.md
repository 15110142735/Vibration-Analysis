Vibration Analysis for Fault Detection using STFT, FFT in Python

I) Feature Extraction using 

A) Skewness
B) Kurtosis
C) Standard Deviation
D) Mean

II) 

Performing FFT to convert from time domain to frequency domain for finding various frequencies from different sources.

Performing STFT to track frequency values and time information together.


To run the program 

Create a Virtual Environment

python -m virtualenv .

Install the Required Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Running the Analysis.ipynb jupyter notebook
